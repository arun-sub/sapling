Sapling-based Alignment

This is a work in progress, but it can be run and produce SAM records using Sapling+Striped-Smith-Waterman.  See the Pending section below to see what remains to be done.  The main program which handles alignment is align.cpp

--------------------------------
Running the full aligner
--------------------------------
To build: `make`
To run: ./align <readsfile> <referencefile> <outfile>
    readsfile should be in FASTQ format
    referencefile should be in FASTA format
    outfile will contain a list of SAM records, one per read with the best alignment.
